# The Importance of Sketchpad

Sketchpad is one of the most influential computer programs ever
written.  It created, among other things, the wholly graphical user
interface.  Sketchpad pioneered interactive computer-aided design.

Sketchpad also pioneered constraint-based programming and
object-oriented design.  The latter has probably had a greater
transformational effect on the field of computer software design than
any other invention since structured programming.

Ivan Sutherland received the Turing Award from the Association for
Computing Machinery in 1988 for (among other achievements) the
invention of Sketchpad.  He has won many other awards for his
groundbreaking work and is recognised as the father of computer
graphics.
