# Sketchpad Listing

This is a transcription of the source code for the
[Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) program.

## About Sketchpad

Sketchpad was written by [Ivan
Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland) and ran on
the [TX-2 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2) at the [MIT
Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/).

Sketchpad is one of the most influential computer programs ever
written; please see [The Importance of Sketchpad](doc/importance.md)
to understand its impact on a number of fields.

## Origin and Format

This listing was produced from the [PDF scans made by the Computer
History
Museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102726903)
of the program listing supplied by Professor Ivan Sutherland.

This transcription, and the conventions it uses, was created by Jurij
Smakov.  The conventions are described in [Listing
Format](doc/format.md).

## Assembling the Source

See [Assembling the Sketchpad Code](doc/assembling.md).

## Current Status

There are (as of 2025-08-24) likely a number of errors in this
transcription - meaning, there will be places where our transcription
differs from the source code used to generate the listing the CHM
holds.  This is primarily because the listing is a photocopy which is
hard to read in many places.  Superscripts and subscripts are
particularly difficult to make out.  Unfortunately superscripts and
subscripts are important features of the TX-2's assembly language.

See [Verifying
Listings](https://tx-2.github.io/software/verifying-listings) for an
explanation of our general approach to verifying listings of TX-2
software.
